Sensor of choosing: I have used a DHT11 sensor (Digital Temperature and Humidity Sensor)
About the sensor: This is a basic temp and humidity sensor, which has a +- 2 degrees of accuracy, and is capable of measuring temps upto 50 degrees Celsius

Due to availibiity of other sensors, I have chosen to complete this assignment with the basic dht11 sensor that was availible. Here, i have taken the measurements from the sensor for 30 seconds, in which at around the 10 second mark I have taken the sensor and enclosed it in my hand, thereby increasing the temperature and humidity measured by it. again after around 15 seconds, i have placed it back on the table.
The readings were recorded every 1 second, and have been uploaded to firebase.

The observations from the data, also coincide that the temp and humidity measure is higher for the time span where it is enclosed, and then quickly comes back to normal.

This same can be applied for various sensors, by installing their respective Raspi packages.
